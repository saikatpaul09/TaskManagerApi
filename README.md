# TaskManagerApi
In this project, we will create a RESTful API using Node.js, Express.js, and NPM packages. The API will allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on tasks. 
Features includes :-
1. GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.
2. GET /tasks/:id: Retrieve a single task by its ID.
3. POST /tasks: Create a new task.
4. PUT /tasks/:id: Update an existing task by its ID.
5. DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task by its ID.
